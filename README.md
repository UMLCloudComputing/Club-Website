    <h1>The UML Cloud Computing Club Website</h1>
</div>


This is the official repo for the UML Cloud Computing Club's website.

The website is implemented using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and some fundamental [ReactJS](https://react.dev/).


## üë®‚Äçüíª Documentation and Tutorials Contribution Guidelines

To edit the documentation sections or the tutorials section of the website:

1. Create a new branch from the **main** branch
2. Make the appropriate edits within this branch
3. Make an eventual pull request for the branch to be merged into **main**
4. Await approval or make the reviewers' requested changes and resubmit


All markdown files containing documentation details of the projects are in **docs/projects/** with the project's name marking the folder that contain's it's documentation

All markdown files containing tutorial details are in **docs/tutorials/** with the specific tutorial's name marking the folder that contain's it's files. 

All markdown files should follow Docusaurus's guidelines for folder structure for autogenerating the UI and pagination. More details are available at the [Docusaurus Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated). 

## üõ§Ô∏è Adding New Repository to Project Docs

To add a new project's docuemtnation onto the project docs section of the website, you must meet a few pre-reqs:

1. The project must be a remote git repository (Github, BitBucket, etc)
2. The project's repository must contain folder with the following structure: <br/>
    ``` shell
        docs 
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web_docs 
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ intro.md | Introduction/
                    _category_.json
    ```
3. The project's documentation files must follow [Docusaurus's](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc) doc creation guidelines. <br/> This inlcudes having proper front-matter and an appropriate `_category_.json` file for each folder. 

Front Matter requirements:
1. All markdown files must have the following front-matter: (`#` is an integer)
``` text
---
sidebar_position: #
---
```

2. Each folder and subfolder must contain a `_category_.json` file. Each `.json` file should be contain the following content:
``` json
{
    "label": "My Project",
    "position": #,
    "link": {
        "type": "generated-index"
    }
}
```
Here the label should be your own. The label indicates the labeled name of the folder or subfolder to be shown. IE project name (`My Project`), subsection name (`Excersices`), etc. <br/>
The position value should also be customized to an `integer` representing the position of your folder or subfolder relative to other subfolders. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to check the position values of current project docs. Do not place conflicting position values to other projects.<br/> In the example below, both `react-mui-resume` and `rowdybot` cannot have the same position values within their `_category_.json` files. Avoid these conflicts in your `_category_.json` files!

``` shell
react-mui-resume
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _category_.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Intro.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rowdybot
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _category_.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Intro.md
```



### In order to add your project:
1. Create a new branch from the **main** branch
2. Name the branch with the following convention: `feat: Add new project docs: PROJECTNAME` with `PROJECTNAME` being the name of your project.
3. Run the following command from within the root directory of your new branch:
    ``` shell
    git submodule add REPO_URL submodules/
    ```
    `REPO_URL` is the **URL** for your repository. Do not confuse this with the `.git` link to your repository. It's specically the **URL**. <br/>
    IE for this very Github repository it's: https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UMLCloudComputing.github.io
4. Open the `submodules_automation.sh` file for editing. Add the proper name of your git repository into the sequence called `projects`. Be sure to include a **space** between your repository name and the name of the previous repository. The **proper** name of your repository is typically simply the name of your repository. To be extra sure, confirm with the name of the folder added to `submodules/` marking your project. That folder is named the **proper** name of your repository. 
5. Run the script you just edited by calling the command `./submodules_automation.sh` or `bash submodules_automation.sh` from the root directory of your branch. 
6. Now your docs have been imported to the website's collection of docs. All that's left is to stage, commit and push the changes from your branch to the main branch.
7. After your pull request is approved, your project's docs will be visible in production on the website!
