Hello everyone, here is the way that I studied for the second exam for Computing II. This exam mainly covers sorting algorithms, data structures, and more. 

### Part 1: Definitions

https://knowt.com/flashcards/23ee910b-2fb1-4ec1-bae6-0094763c5107

First up I made this Knowt card list has the defintions for the following:
- Sorting Algorithms
- Tree Traversals 
- Types of Trees
- Heaps and Their Operations

### Part 2: Practice

There are questions about the following on the exam that you can practice by generating a group of random numbers.

To generate random numbers I used this website (https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/random-number-generator.php).

Practice the following:
- AVL Trees (Visualizer: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
- Fix Down and Fix Up 
- Stacks
- Queues

### Part 3: Priority Queue

Also be sure to review priority time complexities as well.

Use this google doc to help (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_TsJsH-p2rqg07O3XxRjQdpyg_tVHJ0bkVzhoxGC_j8/edit?usp=sharing).

I did not make this doc a friend found it and does not remember the creator but all the credit is to them. I made a copy so hopefully it is up for awhile. 

### Conclusion

These are the resources I used to study for the second exam and the part from this that was on the final. I recommend breaking up your studying and trying to study with friends on a whiteboard because it makes it more fun. Good luck on the exam!

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me on Discord (karmareplicant).
