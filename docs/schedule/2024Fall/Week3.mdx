#### Presentation Section
AWS Core Services <br/>

Presenters: Alvin Yu, Christopher Coco, Nick Bottari <br/>

**IAM**:
- Identity Access MAnagement
- Manage User Accounts and grant fine grained access to AWS Resources
- Mainly used to grant secure premissions to differnt components of your application. <br/>
IAM supports MFA

**AWS EC2**:
- Launches a virtual machine with well defined resources
- General purpose. Can run databases, APIs, storage, websites.
- Billed based on:
    - How LONG the service runs
    - How much DATA is transferred
    - How much STORAGE is attached

**AWS Lambda**:
- Runs without provisioning server resources
- Only billed for the TIME the service runs
- Billed in GB-seconds

**What is an API**:
- Application Programming Interface
- Middleman between two pieces of software
- REST API - type of API for HTTP
    - Representational State Transfer (REST)
    - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

**AWS Lambda vs EC2**:
- EC2 - Constant running service (IE web server)
- Lambda - Occasion operations that need to be run (IE the club's attendance bot)

**AWS API Gateway**:
- AWS Service to proxy and handle HTTP

**AWS S3**:
- Object Storage (not a filesystem, more like an API for uploading, and downloading files)
- Stores "files" as "objects", which are in turn stored in buckets
- Bucket names must be unique in global namespace
- Billing based on:
    - Storage used
    - PUT, GET, DELETE requests

**How to share S3**:
- Get temporary PRESIGNED URL
- Can Upload, download images with REST API
- Example of accessing files on S3 for non-aws users.

**AWS CDK**:
- Generates CloudFormation templates, a declerative way of specifying which AWS services to launch.
- Can be written with Typescript, JS, Python, Golang

[Fireship AWS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzI9JE0i6Lc)
- EC2 was the one the first and most fundamental AWS Services
- Lambda is Serverless
    - Traffic scaling happens in the background
- Outposts is a way to run your own servers with AWS APIs.
- Elastic Container Registery - A place to host your Docker containers
- AWS S3 was the first AWS Service
- Elastic Block Storage - Best for high data throughput
- DynamoDB - Scales fast
- AWS RDS - Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Lake Formation - Creating Data Lakes - Storage unstructed data
- AWS Bedrock - Sagemaker
    - Uses Pytorch or TF
    - Connects to a Juypter Notebook to do development
- Security 
    - AWS IAM
    - AWS Cognito
    - AWs SNS
    - AWS SES  
- AWS Amplify


#### Hands On Section
Beginning development on [PhotoSky](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/photosky) using Github Codespaces. <br/>

Followed through with preliminary configuration of the project, understand the backend architecture, and begin implementing the CDK stack.<br/>

Following through the [PhotoSky Activity](../../activities/welcome.md) to the *Implementing AWS CDK Stack* section. <br/>
