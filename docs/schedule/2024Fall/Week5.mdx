### 📓 Meeting Notes
Virtual: 1 <br/>
In-Person: 25 <br/>

**Introduction to Docker**

Presentor 
- Mathew Harper
- Graduate Student with a keen interest in embedded systems & low level development

Installation:
- Window/Mac
    - Look at the docker reference for docker engine
    - Spin up an EC2 instance and use the Linux guide
        - Remember to set up the security groups correctly
- Linux
    - Follow install guide
    - Use the Docker install script ([Github Repo](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/Docker/tree/main))
- Docker group
    - `sudo usermod -aG docker <user>`
    - `sudo -u $(logname) newgrp docker`

#### Containerization - The Basics
- Machine Virtualization
    - High overhead
    - An entire OS to host each application
- Containers
    - Isolate processes
    - Using container engine
Virtual machines have a lot of overhead. Using docker containers, you can reduce the overhead of having to host a full OS. The container is capable of being a self sustained image to run the application and nothing more.
<br/>
Very easy to deploy and manage across platform, universal platform. 
<br/>

Container Engines
- These are the *programs* that users often (prefer) to interface with
- What do they do for us?
    - Interprate GUI, CLI, or API calls to the lower levels
    - Pull and manage Container images
    - Interface with lower level programs
    - Manage copy-on-write memory of a container

Container Runtime
- This is the *software* responsible for the creation and management of processes
    - Resources
    - images
    - Permissions
- Leverages the *host operating system* and *kernel* often through *runc*

System Constructs
- Dynamic & Static linking
    - Static - Libraries are compiled into the exe
    - Dynamic - Loading and linking handled by OS to shared libraries
- Container might not have access resources for dynamic linking, must be static


#### Terminology
- Namespaces
    - Provide *isolation* between processes
- Cgroups
    - Control *Amount* of resources assigned to a process
- Capabilities
    - Control the *privileges* assigned to a process

Container Constructs
- Images
    - Static and (relatively) unchanging
    - Built off of DockerFile (or equivalent)
- Containers
    - Running instances of images
    - Changes are not (necessarily) persistent
- Volumes
    - Named or Bind Mounts to a location host filesystem
- Networks
    - Defined by docker - separate from the host but routed through the host

Other:
- Docker Socket
    - Management interface
- Rootless docker
    - Docker running processes with uid > 0
- Daemon
    - Generally, some background management process

Docker Files:
- Named *Dockerfile*
- They contain the basic instructions used to construct an *image*
- Built *layer* by *layer*

Docker Alternatives:
- LXC
    - Images are *different*
    - Can use `systemctl`
    - Additional *isolation*

Provided a short demo using Docker with explaination it's outputs

### 🧑‍💻 Hands on Section
Guided Group: 9 <br/>
Work on the activity with help from E-Board with guided explainations for each step.<br/>

Self-guided Group: 8 <br/>
Worked independently on PhotoSky & other personal projects



## 🚀 Next Meeting
- Presentation by [Andrew Aiken](https://github.com/andrew-aiken) regarding AWS Topics & Kubernetes
- Continuing work on PhotoSky and introducing other large scale [club projects](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing)
