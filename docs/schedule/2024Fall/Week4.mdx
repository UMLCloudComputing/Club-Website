Transitioned to the Hands-on Section for [PhotoSky](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/photosky)

### Hands on Section: PhotoSky 

Go over AWS CDK within our project <br/>
- API Gateway
- S3
- Lambda Function
    - Access permissions
- `cdk deploy`
    - Sythesizes a into a `.yml` file that contains the full specification of our cloud Resources
<br/>

What `curl` does:
- Tool used to interact with network services
- Use RESTful API requests


Broke into sessions to work on [PhotoSky](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/photosky). Restarted workflow from scratch with a slightly new docker image. <br/>
More hands off with individuals following the tutorial with E-Board helping out.
